		<h1><b>WARNING:</b></h1>
		<p>A fork bomb is a virus-sort-of-thing designed to repeat/duplicate a process until it overloads the system. In this case, your browser, and possibly your computer (if its a slow one). This fork bomb will open more new tabs endlessly until your browser and/or computer crashes. This is an experiment, and, by continuing, you agree that the developer(s), contributer(s), and site hosting service(s) will not be held reliable for any damage, harm (including but not limited to hardware, software, human(s), other living things, nonliving things, and files) or other form of inconvenience or bad thing(s) that occur by you proceeding. In other words, use at your own risk.</p>
